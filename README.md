## Description

This JavaScript-based Tic Tac Toe game allows a single player to play against the computer. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their symbol (either 'X' or 'O') in empty cells. The objective is to be the first player to place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on the grid.
